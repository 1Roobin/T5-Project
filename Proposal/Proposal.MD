# Project proposal

This Project proposal is for the project of T5 Bootcamp requirements.

# The growth of the temperature over time

As the increase of temperature over time could cause certain issues for the planet, such as global warming[wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)., this project idea came to be to understand how the average temperature is growing over time.

# Aims

To describe the percentage of temperature growth over the years, and build a model to predict the growth for the future years temperature.

# Dataset

I'll use [Daily Temperature of Major Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities/tasks?taskId=1060) dataset that could be found at [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com).

### This database contains observations from 1995 till 2021 for the average temperature

# Tools

EDA tools (***Pandas***,***Numpy***)

Visulizatoin tools (***Seaborn***,***Matplotlib***)

Modeling tools (***sklearn***,***Statsmodels***)

# Steps

* We will start by exploring our data (EDA), then we will create a model to predict the overall increase in temperature.
